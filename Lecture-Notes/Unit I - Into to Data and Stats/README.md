# Unit I - Intro to Data and Stats

This directory contains lecture notes for the first unit of the course, which provides an introduction to data and statistics.

### File Summaries:

*   **`Post Stratification Weights.tex`**: This document explains the concepts of sampling design weights and post-stratification weights in survey statistics. It details how to calculate weights for simple random, stratified, and two-stage sampling designs, and then introduces post-stratification as a method to adjust these weights to match known population characteristics.

*   **`Sampling and Survey Design Weights.tex`**: This document explains how to compute survey weights for two-stage cluster and stratified sampling designs, detailing the calculation of overall selection probabilities and the corresponding weights as their inverse.
