# Lecture Notes

This directory contains a collection of LaTeX files for lecture notes, organized by topic and unit.

### File Summaries:

*   **`1Proportion-CI.tex`**: This document provides a detailed derivation of confidence intervals for proportions, starting from foundational concepts like random variables and probability distributions, and building up through the Bernoulli and Binomial distributions, the Law of Large Numbers, and the Central Limit Theorem.

*   **`1Proportion-HT.tex`**: This document provides a comprehensive guide to hypothesis testing for a single population proportion, starting from the foundational principles of probability and statistical inference. It covers setting up null and alternative hypotheses, understanding sampling distributions and the Central Limit Theorem, calculating the test statistic, determining the rejection region, and interpreting p-values.

*   **`App-Explainer.tex`**: This document explains how to use a hypothesis testing visualizer app, which allows users to simulate data under an alternative hypothesis and test it against a null hypothesis.

*   **`Chi Sq Inference.tex`**: This document provides a detailed explanation of the Chi-Square test of independence, starting from the foundational concept of random variables and building up to the calculation and interpretation of the Chi-Square statistic.

*   **`Chi-Test.tex`**: This document provides a detailed explanation of the Chi-Square Test of Independence, covering its purpose, the setup of hypotheses, the calculation of observed and expected frequencies, the Chi-Square test statistic, and the interpretation of the p-value.

*   **`Confidence Intervals in Polling Reports.tex`**: This document is a follow-along activity on understanding polling reports with confidence intervals, using a real-world CNN poll as an example.

*   **`Core Conceptual Ideas from the Course.tex`**: This document outlines the core conceptual ideas from the first half of a political science statistics course, covering the fundamental goal of statistical inference, the role of descriptive statistics, the importance of probability theory, and the concept of random variables.

*   **`FDR.tex`**: This document provides a comprehensive, first-principles explanation of the False Discovery Rate (FDR) and its application in multiple hypothesis testing.

*   **`Five-Steps-HT-Cookbook.tex`**: This document provides a comprehensive, six-step framework for hypothesis testing across various scenarios, including one- and two-proportion z-tests, large-sample z-tests for means, and small-sample t-tests for means.

*   **`Midsemester Recap.tex`**: This document provides a mid-semester recap for an introductory statistics course in political science, connecting the foundational concepts of descriptive statistics, probability, and random variables to the overarching goal of statistical inference.

*   **`Sample Proportion is a Rescaled Binomial Variable.tex`**: This document explains that a sample proportion is a rescaled binomial random variable, showing how its probability distribution, mean, and variance are derived from the binomial distribution.

*   **`Steps in Hypothesis Testing Problems.tex`**: This document provides a step-by-step guide to hypothesis testing for a population proportion, explaining the theoretical rationale behind each step.

*   **`What is really hypothesis testing.tex`**: This document explains the philosophical underpinnings of hypothesis testing through the lens of Popperian epistemology, emphasizing the concept of falsifiability.
