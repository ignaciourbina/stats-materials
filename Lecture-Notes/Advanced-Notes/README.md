- **`Stats-is-about-Integrals.tex`**: This document argues that statistics is
  fundamentally about integrals, framing various statistical concepts as either
  direct applications or transformations of integrals. It explains how
  expectations, variances, probabilities, and even sample statistics can be
  viewed through the lens of Lebesgue-Stieltjes or empirical integrals,
  providing a unifying theoretical perspective on estimation and inference.
