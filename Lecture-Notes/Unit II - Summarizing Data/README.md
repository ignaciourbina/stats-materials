# Unit II - Summarizing Data

This directory contains lecture notes for the second unit of the course, which
focuses on summarizing data.

## File Summaries

- **`Notes-Lecture Week 2.tex`**: This document contains lecture notes and
  solved problems for a statistics course, covering the impact of outliers on
  the sample mean, the calculation of relative and cumulative frequencies for
  categorical ordinal data, and the computation of the weighted mean.

- **`Sample Variance - Alternative Computation.tex`**: This document provides a
  derivation and an example of an alternative formula for computing the sample
  variance using the sum of squares of the observations, the sample mean, and
  the sample size.

- **`Sample Variance and Euclidean Distance.tex`**: This document explains the
  connection between sample variance and Euclidean distance, demonstrating that
  the sample variance is proportional to the squared Euclidean distance of the
  data points from their mean. It also provides a detailed explanation of
  Bessel's correction.
