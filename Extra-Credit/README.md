# Extra-Credit

This directory contains materials for extra credit assignments.

### File Summaries:

*   **Extra-Credit.tex**: This document is a homework assignment for a political science statistics course, explaining the concepts of sampling error and design effects in polling. It introduces the standard error of a sample proportion under simple random sampling and then explains how complex survey designs, such as stratification and clustering, can increase variance, which is quantified by the design effect (Deff).

*   **Proportion Sampling Distribution of Stratified Sample.tex**: This document outlines the formulas for calculating the estimated proportion and its variance for a stratified sample. It explains that the overall stratified sample proportion is a weighted average of the individual stratum sample proportions, where the weights are determined by the relative size of each stratum in the population.
