# Figures

This directory contains figures used in the lecture slides and other course
materials.

## File Summaries

- **`538 2024 Election Forcast-2.png`**: This is a screenshot of a
  FiveThirtyEight article showing the 2024 election forecast, including a map of
  the United States with predicted outcomes for the presidential election. The
  article discusses the methodology of the forecast model and each candidate's
  chances of winning.

- **`538-2024-Projections-cropped.pdf`**: This document contains a dot plot
  visualizing simulated electoral college outcomes. The plot shows the
  distribution of potential electoral vote margins, with outcomes favoring
  Harris on the left and Trump on the right.

- **`binomial_distribution.pdf`**: This document contains two bar charts
  illustrating properties of a binomial distribution with N=20. The left chart
  displays the probability mass function (PMF), while the right chart shows each
  outcome's contribution to the expected value.

- **`Coin_Flips_Sim.pdf`**: This document displays a histogram illustrating the
  empirical distribution of the proportion of heads in 1000 coin flip
  simulations. The distribution is centered around 0.5, which is the expected
  value.

- **`correlation.png`**: This is a three-panel xkcd comic that humorously
  illustrates the statistical principle that correlation does not imply
  causation.

- **`Diagram-Variable-Types.pdf`**: This document contains a flowchart that
  categorizes variable types into numerical (quantitative) and categorical
  (qualitative), and further subdivides them into continuous/discrete and
  nominal/ordinal.

- **`donor_hist.pdf`**: This document displays a histogram of donor
  contributions, showing the frequency of donations within different value
  ranges. The highest frequency of contributions is in the \$35-\$40 range.

- **`paired_diff.pdf`**: This document displays a histogram of turnout
  differences, calculated as "After - Before." The majority of the differences
  are negative, indicating a decrease in turnout.

- **`qq_example.pdf`**: This document displays a histogram of a right-skewed
  sample and a corresponding Q-Q plot. The deviation of the points from the
  reference line in the Q-Q plot illustrates the sample's non-normality.

- **`t_vs_norm.pdf`**: This document contains a plot comparing the probability
  density functions of a standard normal distribution and two Student's
  t-distributions (with 4 and 15 degrees of freedom). The plot illustrates that
  as the degrees of freedom increase, the t-distribution approaches the normal
  distribution.

- **`triangular_distribution.pdf`**: This document contains two plots related to
  a triangular distribution. The left plot shows the probability density
  function (PDF) of the distribution, and the right plot shows each value's
  contribution to the expected value.
