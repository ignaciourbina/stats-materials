\section*{Section 1 (11 points total)}

\noindent\textbf{Instructions:}
Suppose an artificial intelligence (AI), like ChatGPT, is playing \emph{four consecutive rounds} of the card game \emph{Uno} against a \emph{sophisticated, but rule-based} computer algorithm. Unlike the AI, which adapts its strategy dynamically, the rule-based algorithm follows a fixed decision-making process (i.e., the algorithm is just a set of step-by-step instructions telling the computer exactly how to respond to each card or game event).

We run \emph{one billion} simulations of these four-round matches. Based on these simulations, we estimate the \textbf{probability mass function (PMF)} of $X$, the number of rounds won by the AI in a given match:
\[
P(X = k) = p_k, \quad k = 0,1,2,3,4
\]
where:
\[
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c}
X & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\hline
P(X = k) & 0.10 & 0.25 & 0.30 & 0.20 & 0.15 \\
\end{array}
\]

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \underline{Question 1.1}: Compute the \emph{expected number of rounds won} by the AI in a match. Then, \emph{explain what this value represents in the context of the game}. How does this help us understand the AI's performance?  (\textbf{6 points})
        \blankbox[6cm]{1.06\textwidth}
    \item \underline{Question 1.2}: Compute the \emph{probability that $X$ is higher than $E[X]$}. \emph{Interpret} this probability in the context of the AI's performance in individual matches. (\textbf{5 points})
        \blankbox[5cm]{1.06\textwidth}


\end{enumerate}

    %\item \underline{Question 3.3}: \emph{Interpretation}: If you were designing a new AI to play Uno, would you say that the current AI is dominant over the rule-based algorithm? Justify your answer using the probabilities given. \blankbox[5cm]{1.06\textwidth}

\noindent\textbf{Instructions:}
For each \emph{statement} below, determine whether it is \texttt{True} or \texttt{False} and circle your choice. Then, provide a clear and well-reasoned explanation to support your answer. Justification is valued more than simply selecting the correct option, with 1 point awarded for the correct selection and 2 points for a well-explained justification. \emph{Clearly explain the formulas you use and the calculations you perform}.


\begin{enumerate}

\item \underline{Question 3.1}: A survey was conducted to understand the voting preferences of urban and rural residents in a state ahead of the upcoming gubernatorial election. It included 1,000 randomly selected participants, with 700 from urban areas and 300 from rural areas. Among urban residents, 350 supported the current governor, while 180 rural residents also expressed their support.

\noindent
\begin{tabular}{p{0.75\textwidth} p{0.04\textwidth} p{0.15\textwidth}}

\item \underline{Question 3.2}: A survey was conducted to examine the relationship between voting behavior and support for a new healthcare policy among adults in a city. Based on the survey data, the following probabilities were reported: \emph{i}) The probability that an adult supports the new healthcare policy is 40\%; \emph{ii}) The probability that an adult voted in the last election is 60\%; \emph{iii}) The probability that an adult supports the policy given that they voted is 50\%.

\item \underline{Question 3.3}:  A jury of three members is deciding on a verdict. Each juror makes a statistically independent decision. Let \( X_i \) be a binary random variable representing the decision of juror \( i \), where \( X_i = 1 \) if the juror votes guilty and \( X_i = 0 \) if the juror votes not guilty.   The probability that each juror votes guilty is as follows: \( P(X_1 = 1) = 0.3 \), \( P(X_2 = 1) = 0.4 \), and \( P(X_3 = 1) = 0.2 \).
