\section*{Instructions}
In this quiz, you will:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use a provided app to run a $z$-test for a population proportion.
    \item Input the sample size, sample proportion, and null-hypothesis value.
    \item Select the appropriate test type and significance level as described in each question.
    \item Answer a series of multiple-choice questions based on your results from the app.
    \item Download the summary Excel report generated by the app and upload it as your proof of independent work (\textbf{5 points}).
    \item Upload a screenshot showing that you used the app correctly, \emph{and} upload the resulting Excel summary report file (\textbf{5 points}).
\end{itemize}

Before tackling the hypothesis-testing practical problem, you will answer a couple of conceptual-review questions.

\section*{Hypothesis Testing Quiz — Transcription}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Which of the following best describes the role of the null hypothesis in hypothesis testing for a proportion?}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item It adjusts the population proportion based on the sample data.
        \item It claims that the sample was biased and not randomly selected.
        \item It assumes the sample proportion is the true population proportion.
        \item \textbf{It specifies a fixed value of the population proportion to test against.}
    \end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{What does it mean if your calculated $z$-statistic falls inside the rejection region?}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{The sample result is significantly different from the null, so you reject the null hypothesis.}
        \item You need to collect more data before making a conclusion.
        \item The alternative hypothesis is definitely true.
        \item The null hypothesis is definitely true.
    \end{enumerate}

\item Suppose you are part of a research team that is investigating how students who have declared a political science major feel about the president’s handling of the economy. You ran a survey that measures whether each student either approves (1) or disapproves (0) of the president’s economic policies. \newline 

Suppose you have been given a random sample of 100 political science majors, drawn from the student population at Stony Brook. Further, suppose that the calculated sample proportion of students who approve is 58\%. The goal is to use this sample to test whether the population proportion of students who approve is statistically different from 0.50.  \newline 

\textbf{3. Which of the following correctly states the null and alternative hypotheses?}
\[
\begin{array}{ll}
(A)& H_{0}\!:\; p = 0.50 \quad H_{A}\!:\; p > 0.50\\[4pt]
(B)& H_{0}\!:\; p = 0.50 \quad H_{A}\!:\; p < 0.50\\[4pt]
(C)& \mathbf{H_{0}\!:\; p = 0.50 \quad H_{A}\!:\; p \neq 0.50}\\[4pt]
(D)& H_{0}\!:\; \hat{p} = 0.50 \quad H_{A}\!:\; \hat{p} \neq 0.50
\end{array}
\]

\item \textbf{Which of the following correctly states whether the normal approximation is appropriate as the sampling distribution of the test statistic?}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Yes, it is appropriate because both $np_{0}$ and $n(1-p_{0})$ are greater than 15.}
        \item No, it is not appropriate because we don't know the standard deviation.
        \item Yes, it is appropriate because $\hat{p}$ is close to 0.50.
        \item No, it is not appropriate because the sample size is not greater than 30.
    \end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Using the provided app, compute the test statistic. Which of the following is closest to the correct value of the test statistic?}
\[
\begin{array}{ll}
(A)& z \approx 1.96\\
(B)& z \approx 11.75\\
(C)& \mathbf{z \approx 1.60}\\
(D)& z \approx 2.43\\
(E)& z \approx 10
\end{array}
\]

\item \textbf{Suppose the significance level is $\alpha = 0.05$. Which of the following best describes the rejection region for this two-sided test?}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Reject $H_{0}$ if $|z| > 2.58$
        \item Reject $H_{0}$ if $z < -1.645$
        \item Reject $H_{0}$ if $z > 1.645$
        \item \textbf{Reject $H_{0}$ if $|z| > 1.96$}
    \end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Based on your test statistic and the rejection region, what is the correct decision?}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Reject $H_{0}$; there is sufficient evidence that the proportion is different from 0.50.
        \item Reject $H_{0}$; the sample proportion is numerically different than 0.5.
        \item Fail to reject $H_{0}$; the population is not normal.
        \item \textbf{Fail to reject $H_{0}$; there is not enough evidence that the proportion is different from 0.50.}
    \end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Which of the following is the most appropriate conclusion?}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The sample shows that 50\% of political science majors approve, so no difference exists in the population.
        \item There is significant evidence that the approval rate among political science majors is greater than 50\%.
        \item Political science majors strongly disapprove of the president's handling of the economy.
        \item \textbf{There is not enough evidence to conclude that the approval rate among political science majors is different from 50\%.}
    \end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
