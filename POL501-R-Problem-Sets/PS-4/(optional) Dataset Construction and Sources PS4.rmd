## Datasets Used

### VDEM (Varieties of Democracy) Dataset
The **VDEM (Varieties of Democracy)** dataset is a comprehensive source of data that provides detailed information about the political and democratic characteristics of countries around the world. It includes a wide range of indicators related to political systems, governance, elections, civil liberties, and political representation. The dataset aims to capture the complex nature of democracies, tracking changes over time in different dimensions of democratic governance.

- **Focus**: Political metrics, including governance, political freedoms, representation, and leadership.
- **Usage in Analysis**: The dataset was used to analyze the presence of female leaders, representation in the legislature, and other political characteristics across countries from 1994 to 2014.

### WDI (World Development Indicators) Dataset
The **WDI (World Development Indicators)** dataset, published by the World Bank, is a key resource for global development data. It provides economic, social, and demographic statistics, offering insights into the development progress of nations. The dataset includes indicators on health, education, economic activity, population, and other developmental metrics that reflect the living conditions and quality of life in different countries.

- **Focus**: Socioeconomic metrics, including health, economic performance, and social development indicators.
- **Usage in Analysis**: The dataset was used to capture key socioeconomic indicators such as adolescent fertility rate, infant mortality rate, and life expectancy at birth, averaged over the years 2015-2018. These indicators were used to understand development outcomes following the political conditions captured by VDEM.

Together, the **VDEM** and **WDI** datasets provide a comprehensive view of both political and socioeconomic dimensions of countries, facilitating analysis of the linkages between political governance and development outcomes.

## Pre-Processing Steps

Here is a high-level overview of the steps taken to create the final cross-sectional dataset. These steps were carried out in an additional supplementary code script.

### High-Level Overview of the Steps:

1. **Filtering VDEM Data**:
   - Removed specific countries (`Kosovo` and `Serbia`) and filtered data to include only the years from **1994 to 2014**. `Kosovo` and `Serbia` did not have an easely identifiable country code to match the observations between the WDI and VDEM datasets.

2. **Filtering WDI Data**:
   - Selected data from the **WDI** dataset for the years **2015 to 2018**, representing key socioeconomic indicators after 2014.

3. **Calculating Averages for Socioeconomic Indicators**:
   - For each country, calculated average values of **adolescent fertility rate**, **infant mortality rate**, and **life expectancy** over the years **2015-2018**.

4. **Preparing VDEM Dataset**:
   - Selected relevant political variables from VDEM and created an indicator for female leadership.
   - Calculated the average presence of female **Head of State** or **Head of Government** from **1994 to 2014**.

5. **Filtering and Merging**:
   - Filtered the VDEM data to include only the year **2014** and then merged it with the **WDI** data to create a cross-sectional dataset anchored to **2014**.

6. **Creating a Female Leadership Indicator**:
   - Added a new variable to indicate if a country had at least one female political leader between **1994 and 2014**.

7. **Summarizing Western Countries**:
   - Produced a summary table to show the distribution of western countries that had at least one female **Head of State** or **Head of Government** during **1994-2014**.

The final cross-sectional dataset focuses on political and socioeconomic conditions around the year **2014**, enabling analysis of the impact of female political leadership on subsequent socioeconomic outcomes.
