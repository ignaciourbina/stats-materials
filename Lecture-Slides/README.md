# Lecture Slides

This directory contains the LaTeX source files for the lecture slides of the course.
The slides cover a wide range of topics in statistics, from introductory concepts
to statistical inference.

## File Summaries

- **`LS1-Intro to Data and Stats.tex`**: This LaTeX document contains the slides
  for an introductory lecture on data and statistics in political science. It
  covers fundamental concepts such as populations, samples, estimators,
  variables, and the distinction between observational and experimental studies,
  as well as an overview of sampling methods and potential biases.

- **`LS10-Sampling Distributions for Means.tex`**: This LaTeX document contains
  the slides for a lecture on the sampling distributions of sample means,
  covering both single and two-sample cases. It explains the Central Limit
  Theorem, the plug-in principle for unknown variances, and the use of the
  t-distribution for small samples.

- **`LS11-Large Sample Inference for Means.tex`**: This LaTeX document contains
  the slides for a lecture on large-sample inference for means, covering
  confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for one mean, two independent means,
  and paired samples.

- **`LS12-Small Sample Inference for Means.tex`**: This LaTeX document contains
  the slides for a lecture on small-sample inference for means using the
  Student's t-distribution. It covers one-sample and two-sample (both paired
  and independent) t-tests and confidence intervals, and the distinction between
  pooled and Welch's t-tests.

- **`LS2-Descriptive Stats.tex`**: This LaTeX document contains the slides for a
  lecture on descriptive statistics, covering measures of central tendency,
  dispersion, and position, as well as different types of distributions and the
  concept of summarizing data.

- **`LS3-Distributions and Graphs.tex`**: This LaTeX document contains the slides
  for a lecture on summarizing data with graphs, covering the shape of
  distributions, histograms, bar plots, box plots, dot charts, and scatter
  plots.

- **`LS4-Intro to Probability.tex`**: This LaTeX document contains the slides for
  an introductory lecture on probability, covering random processes, outcomes,
  events, set theory basics, and the definitions and axioms of probability.

- **`LS4-v2-Intro to Probability.tex`**: This LaTeX document contains the slides
  for an introductory lecture on probability, covering random processes,
  outcomes, events, set theory basics, and the definitions and axioms of
  probability.

- **`LS5-Intro to Random Variables.tex`**: This LaTeX document contains the
  slides for a lecture on random variables, covering the distinction between
  discrete and continuous random variables, probability mass functions (PMFs),
  probability density functions (PDFs), and cumulative distribution functions
  (CDFs).

- **`LS6-Expected Value.tex`**: This LaTeX document contains the slides for a
  lecture on expected value and population parameters, covering the formal
  definitions of expectation and variance for both discrete and continuous
  random variables.

- **`LS7-Estimators and Sampling Distributions.pdf`**: This PDF document contains
  the slides for a lecture on estimators and sampling distributions, covering
  the properties of estimators, the concept of sampling variability, and the
  Central Limit Theorem.

- **`LS8-Inference for one Proportion.tex`**: This LaTeX document contains the
  slides for a lecture on statistical inference for a single proportion,
  covering the sampling distribution of the sample proportion, confidence
  intervals, and hypothesis testing.

- **`LS9-Inference for two Proportions.tex`**: This LaTeX document contains the
  slides for a lecture on statistical inference for two proportions, covering
  the sampling distribution of the difference in sample proportions, confidence
  intervals, and hypothesis testing.

- **`name.tex`**: This LaTeX document is a Beamer presentation preamble that
  includes packages for mathematics, graphics, tables, and plots, and defines
  two CSV data files for use in the presentation.

- **`preamble.txt`**: This LaTeX document is a preamble for a Beamer
  presentation, setting up a variety of packages for mathematics, graphics,
  tables, and plots, and defining custom colors, commands, and environments.
