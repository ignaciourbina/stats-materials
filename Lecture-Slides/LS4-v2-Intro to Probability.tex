    \frametitle{Why Study Probability?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We want to understand how likely an event is.
        \pause
        \item Compare events to say which is more likely.
        \pause
        \item When we say an event is more likely, we expect it to happen more than less likely events.
        \pause
        \item Likelihood and probability reflect our belief about the chances of events occurring.
        \pause
        \item Examples:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item We can say very confidently that the sun will rise tomorrow or ``\emph{there is a very high probability the sun will rise tomorrow}." \pause
            \item We can say very confidently that in the middle of summer, it won't snow or ``\emph{There is a low probability of snow in the middle of summer}."
        \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{A Solid Understanding of Probability }
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Provides a framework to deal with uncertainty and randomness.
        \pause
        \item Our expectations about likely events influence our actions and planning.
        \pause
        \item Examples:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Planning an outdoor event based on the weather forecast. \pause
            \item Buy a stock based on its price forecast. \pause
            \item Settle on a court case based on the probability of losing the lawsuit. \pause
        \end{itemize}
    \item We study probabilities of \textbf{random processes}.

\pause

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The outcome is drawn from a set of all possible outcomes. \pause
        \item Examples:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Weather: We cannot predict with certainty if it will rain tomorrow.
        \pause
        \item Throwing a die: The result of a die throw is unknown until it happens.
        \pause
        \item Elections: The winning candidate is uncertain until votes are counted.

    \frametitle{What is a Random Process?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What do we mean by ``process"?
        \pause
        \item \textbf{Process:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A process is a mapping from an initial state to a later state, i.e., a sequence of connected steps.
            \pause
            \item Example: Applying for a scholarship (learning about it, writing the application, submitting it, getting the result).
            \pause
            \item Initial conditions lead to a new condition through a series of steps.
        \end{itemize}
        \pause
        \item \textbf{Random Process:} A random process involves initial conditions leading to an uncertain outcome.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Initial conditions: Current temperature, wind patterns, humidity, etc.
        \pause
        \item These factors interact in a complex way.
        \pause
        \item Outcome: Weather tomorrow (rain, sun, etc.).
        \pause
        \item Unpredictable middle steps make the final outcome uncertain.
        \pause
        \item Small changes in conditions can lead to different weather outcomes.

\begin{frame}{Set Theory - Basic Definitions}
    \textbf{Definition:} A set is a collection of well-defined, unordered objects called elements or members.  \pause

    \textbf{Explicit Set Definition:} A (finite) set can be defined by explicitly specifying all of its elements between curly braces, known as set braces \{\}. \pause

    For example,
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$\pause
        \item $B = \{a, e, i, o, u\}$\pause

        \item $ S = \{\{h, h\},\{h, t\},\{t, h\},\{t, t\}\} $ (outcomes of two coin tosses)

    \textbf{Review:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The null set (or empty set) is denoted by \(\emptyset\).\pause

        \item The intersection of sets \(A \cap B\) includes elements common to both \(A\) and \(B\).\pause
        \item The complement of a set $\neg D$ or \(D^c\) includes all elements not in \(D\).\pause
        \item Mutually exclusive (or disjoint) events are sets with no common elements.\pause
        \item A series of exhaustive events cover all possible outcomes in the sample space.\pause
        \item The universe set, $U$, is the set that contains all possible elements.

\definitionbox{Definition}{The probability of an event is the proportion of times the event would occur if we observed the random process an infinite number of times. }
\pause

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Probability is defined as the long-run frequency of an event occurring.  \pause
        \item Example: Flipping a coin many times and observing the proportion of heads.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Definitions of Probability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Classical Definition}
\end{itemize}

\definitionbox{Definition}{The probability of an event is the number of ways it can happen divided by the total number of possible outcomes, assuming all outcomes are equally likely.}
\pause

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Example: Rolling a fair six-sided die, the probability of getting a number lower than 3 (so, either 1 or 2) is \( \frac{1+1}{6} =\frac{2}{6} \). \pause
        \item Note that this definition is only valid when all outcomes are equally likely. \pause
        \item Therefore, is it useful to calculate probabilities for the outcome of a fair die $\{1,2, \cdots, 6\}$, but not for the outcome of a single specific election $\{\text{Candidate A Wins}, \text{Candidate B Wins}\}$.

\frametitle{Challenges with One-Shot Events}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Many events cannot be repeated under identical conditions. \pause
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Example: A specific election outcome. \pause
    \end{itemize}
    \item Frequentist and classical definitions struggle with one-shot events. \pause
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What does it mean to repeat an election? \pause
        \item How do we count all possible outcomes for a unique event? \pause
    \end{itemize}
    \item We need additional assumptions in these cases. \pause
    \item How we define our population becomes crucial in calculating probabilities. \pause
    \item This often means we need to make our research question more general.
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Classical Probability in the Context of Elections}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Calculating Probabilities in Electoral Contexts}: \pause
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Collect data from a large number of past elections within a given country or state. \pause
        \item Ensure these elections are comparable (e.g., same country/state, similar conditions). \pause
        \item Calculate the probability of a candidate with specific characteristics (e.g., gender, age, race) getting elected. \pause
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Example}: \pause
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Suppose} we have data from 200 \textbf{comparable elections}. Define this as the \textbf{population}. \pause
        \item In 55 of these elections, a woman candidate won. \pause
        \item Probability of a woman candidate winning \emph{in our population of elections}:  \pause
        \[
        \frac{\text{Number of Favorable Cases}}{\text{Total Number of Cases}} = \frac{110}{200} = 0.55

\begin{frame}{Why it’s important to learn probability to understand statistics}
    Suppose that the Office of Student Life claims that 45\% of Stony Brook students are registered to vote in the next presidential election. \pause Then, suppose we take a random sample of 100 students and determine that the proportion registered is:
    \[
    \frac{53}{100} = 0.53 \quad \quad  \text{(That is, 53\%)}
    \] \pause
    Now, we need to ask the question: \
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{If the actual population proportion is 0.45, how likely is it that we’d get a sample proportion of 0.53?} \pause
        \item If the answer is “\emph{fairy likely},” the initial claim is reasonable. If not, we reject it.  \pause
    \end{itemize}
    Learning about probability allows us to answer such questions.

    \begin{block}{Probability Function}
    Probability is a real-valued function \(P\) that assigns to each event \(A\) in a sample space \(S\) a number known as the \textbf{probability of the event \(A\)}, denoted by \(P(A)\).

        \item \(P(S) = 1\), where \(S\) is the sample space. (Certainty)\pause
        \item For any sequence, \(A_1, A_2, \ldots A_k\), of mutually exclusive events, i.e., $A_j \cap A_i =\emptyset$, , \[P\left(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \cdots \cup A_k \right) = P(A_1)+P(A_2)+P(A_3) + \cdots + P(A_k)\] (Additivity)\pause

    \textbf{Problem Statement:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We toss \textbf{two fair coins}.
        \item We define an \textbf{event} as a specific \textbf{number of heads} observed.
        \item Our goal is to determine the probability distribution of the different realizations of this outcome.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Sample Space:} The possible outcomes of flipping two fair coins are:
    \[
    S = \{ HH, HT, TH, TT \}
    \]
    where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(HH\): Both coins land on heads.
        \item \(HT\) and \(TH\): One coin lands on heads, the other on tails.
        \item \(TT\): Both coins land on tails.

    \textbf{Step 1: Count the Outcomes for Each Event}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(X = 0\) (No heads): \( \{TT\} \) → 1 outcome \pause
        \item \(X = 1\) (One head): \( \{HT, TH\} \) → 2 outcomes \pause
        \item \(X = 2\) (Two heads): \( \{HH\} \) → 1 outcome

            0 & \( TT \) & \( 1/4 = 0.25 \) \\  \pause
            1 & \( HT, TH \) & \( 2/4  = 0.50 \) \\  \pause

    The addition rule for disjoint (mutually exclusive) events states that if two events \( A \) and \( B \) cannot occur at the same time, then the probability of \( A \) or \( B \) occurring is the sum of their probabilities.\pause

    \[ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) \]\pause

    Example:\pause
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Let $A$ be ``At least one country is not a democracy AND They have low economic dependence AND The country pair has never been been at war".\pause
        \item Let $B$ "Both countries are democratic AND they have low economic dependence AND they have never been at war."\pause

% Slide for General Addition Rule
\begin{frame}{General Addition Rule for Probabilities}
    The general addition rule is used to find the probability that either of two events occurs.\pause

    \begin{block}{Formula}
        If \(A\) and \(B\) are any two events, then the probability that \(A\) or \(B\) occurs is given by:\pause

        P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
        \]\pause
    \end{block}

    \textbf{Explanation:}\pause
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(P(A \cup B)\) is the probability of either \(A\) or \(B\) occurring.\pause
        \item \(P(A) + P(B)\) adds the probabilities of \(A\) and \(B\) occurring.\pause
        \item Subtracting \(P(A \cap B)\) corrects for the double counting of the intersection, where both \(A\) and \(B\) occur.

\begin{frame}{Example}
    \textbf{Example:}\\[0.5ex]
    Let \(A\) be “a country is a democracy” and \(B\) be “a country has low inequality.” Consider a scenario where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(P(A) = 0.60\) (Probability of being a democracy),\pause
        \item \(P(B) = 0.58\) (Probability of having low inequality),\pause
        \item \(P(A \cap B) = 0.42\) (Probability of being both Democratic and having low inequality).\pause
    \end{itemize}

    Using the general addition rule:
    \[
    P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) = 0.60 + 0.58 - 0.42 = 0.76
    \]

    Thus, if we select a random country from the sample, the probability that it is either Democratic or has Low Inequality is 76\%.
\end{frame}

% Slide for Probability of the Complement
\begin{frame}{Probability of the Complement}

    \begin{block}{Derivation}
        Consider an event \(A\) and its complement \(A^c\). Since \(A\) and \(A^c\) are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, the addition rule gives:\pause
        \[
        P(A \cup A^c) = P(A) + P(A^c) - P(A \cap A^c)
        \]\pause
        Because \(A\) and \(A^c\) are mutually exclusive, \(P(A \cap A^c) = 0\). \pause Also, \(A \cup A^c\) covers the entire sample space, so \(P(A \cup A^c) = P(S) = 1\). \pause Thus:
        \[
        1 = P(A) + P(A^c)
        \] \pause
    \end{block}
    \pause
    \textbf{Consequently:}
    \[
    P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)
    \]
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example: Law School Applications}
    \emph{Suppose a student estimates a 15\% chance of being accepted by any given law school. Assuming acceptance decisions are independent, how many schools should they apply to have a probability of getting accepted to at least one school be higher than 80\%?}
    \pause
\vspace{1em}
\footnotesize

    Let \( A \) be the event of being accepted to one particular school, so:
    \[
    P(A) = 0.15, \quad P(A^c) = 0.85.
    \]
    \pause
    If the student applies to \( n \) schools (assuming independent decisions), the probability of being rejected by all schools is:
    \[
    P(\text{no acceptances}) = (0.85) \times (0.85) \cdots \times (0.85)  = (0.85)^n.
    \]
    \pause
    Therefore, the probability of at least one acceptance is:
    \[
    P(\text{at least one acceptance}) = 1 - (0.85)^n.
    \]
    \pause
    We want this probability to be at least 80\%. If try for different $n$ we see that 10 is the minimum number of applications such that $P(\text{at least one}) \geq 0.80$

\begin{frame}{Introduction to Conditional Probability}
    \textbf{Overview:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Conditional probability is a measure of the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred.\pause
        \item This type of probability is essential in scenarios where the occurrence of one event affects the likelihood of another.\pause
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Concept:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Instead of considering all possible outcomes, conditional probability focuses only on the outcomes where a specific condition or event has occurred.\pause
        \item Useful in situations like medical testing, where we might be interested in the probability of a disease given a positive test result.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Formula for Conditional Probability}
    \textbf{Conditional Probability Defined:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The probability of an event \( A \) given that event \( B \) has occurred is written as \( P(A|B) \).\pause
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Formula:}\pause
    \[
    P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
    \]\pause
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This formula assumes that \( P(B) > 0 \), i.e., the condition event \( B \) has a non-zero probability of occurring.\pause
        \item Note that $P(A|B) \neq P(B|A)$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{General Multiplication Rule}
\begin{itemize}
        \item Note that this gives a general formula for $P(A \cap B)$
        $$P(A \cap B) = P(A|B)\cdot P(B) = P(B|A)\cdot P(A)$$
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example: Using Conditional Probability}
    \textbf{Problem Setup:}

        \item We draw two marbles \textbf{without replacement}.
        \item We want the probability of drawing a blue marble first, then a red marble.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Calculation:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Probability of drawing a blue marble first: \(\displaystyle \frac{4}{10}\).
        \item Probability of then drawing a red marble (given blue was drawn): \(\displaystyle \frac{6}{9}\).

What's the probability of the event ``Country 2 invests in nuclear weapons ($\text{Invest}_2$), but Country 1 does not ($\text{Not}_1$)''

We can use the following rule: $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B|A) $
\vspace{0.5cm}

    \textbf{Calculation:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item According to the respective branch of the tree: $P(\text{Invest}_2 | \text{Not}_1)=0.3$ \pause
        \item Also, \(P(\text{Not}_1) = 0.6\).\pause

\begin{frame}{Law of Total Probability - Intuition}
    \textbf{Intuition:} \pause
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The Law of Total Probability helps us calculate the probability of an event by considering all possible ways that event can occur.\pause
        \item It involves breaking down the event into mutually exclusive cases by conditioning on a different event.\pause
        \item Consider the following example. What's the probability of randomly selecting one Senator and that they are woman?
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Law of Total Probability - Example}

Define the events $B$ and $A$. We can split the event $B$ into two cases 1) $B$ and $A$ happen, and 2) $B$ and $A^c$ (not $A$) happens.  \newline
\vspace{0.5em}


Consider the following example. Assume $N_W$ current senators are woman. Define $O$ as the event ``a senator is older than 80 years.'' And define the event $W \cap O$ as the event ``A senator is woman \underline{and} older than 80 years.'' Hence, it must be the case that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $N_W = N_{W\cap O} + N_{W\cap O^c}$
    \item Total Woman Senators = \# (Woman \& Older than 80) + \# (Woman \& Younger than 80).
    \item Assume that $N$ is the total number of senators. Then,
    \item $\frac{N_W}{N} = \frac{N_{W\cap O}}{N}+ \frac{N_{W\cap O^c}}{N}$
    \item $P(W) = P(W \cap O) + P(W \cap O^c)$.
\end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The Law of Total Probability calculates the probability of an event by breaking it down into the mutually exclusive cases the event can happen jointly with another.\pause

    \textbf{Formula:}
    $$  P(B) = P(B \cap A) + P(B\cap A^c)  $$
    Alternatively, applying the general multiplication rule:
    $$ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) $$

        \item We randomly choose a bag, with a 50\% chance of picking either. What's the probability of drawing a blue marble ($B$)?

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Let \(A\) be the event of choosing Bag One, and \(A^c\) be the event of choosing Bag Two.\pause
        \item \(P(B|A) = 0.3\) (Probability of blue marble from Bag One)\pause
