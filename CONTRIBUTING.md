# Contributing to Statistics Materials

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this collection of course
materials. To ensure consistency and maintainability, please follow these
guidelines.

## Git Workflow and Commit Protocol

To maintain a clean and understandable project history, we follow a specific
protocol for committing and pushing changes. All changes should be staged,
committed, and pushed using the following command structure:

```bash
git add . && git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message here" && git push
```

Please replace `"Your descriptive commit message here"` with a concise and
informative message that clearly explains the changes you have made.

## Reporting Issues

If you find a typo, an error in a formula, or a bug in a script, please open an
issue on the GitHub repository. Please provide a clear and descriptive title and
include as much detail as possible in the issue description.

## Proposing Changes

For more significant changes, such as adding new problem sets, reorganizing
folders, or updating large portions of the material, please follow these steps:

1. Create a new branch for your changes.
2. Make your changes on that branch.
3. Open a Pull Request to merge your branch into the `main` branch.
4. In the Pull Request description, clearly explain the changes you have made
   and why.

## File Naming Conventions

To maintain a consistent structure, please follow these naming conventions when
adding new files:

- **Problem Sets**: `PS-X.tex` (e.g., `PS-8.tex`)
- **Problem Set Solutions**: `Sol-PS-X.tex` (e.g., `Sol-PS-8.tex`)
- **Quizzes**: `Quiz-X.tex` (e.g., `Quiz-9.tex`)
- **Quiz Solutions**: `Quiz-X-Solutions.tex` (e.g., `Quiz-9-Solutions.tex`)

Thank you for helping to improve these materials!
