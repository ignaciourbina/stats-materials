## File Summaries

- **`analysis-sopa_pipa.pdf`**: This document analyzes the relationship between
  lobbying money and congressional stances on the SOPA/PIPA bills, finding a
  strong correlation between net lobbying contributions and voting behavior,
  even after accounting for party affiliation.

- **`Code SOPA Project.R`**: This R script analyzes the `piracy.csv` dataset to
  investigate the relationship between lobbying money, party affiliation, and
  congressional stances on the SOPA/PIPA bills. It performs data cleaning,
  visualization, chi-squared tests, and t-tests to explore these associations.

- **`piracy.csv`**: This CSV file contains data on 534 U.S. Senators and
  Representatives, including their name, party, state, lobbying money received
  for and against the SOPA/PIPA bills, years in office, stance on the bills, and
  chamber.
