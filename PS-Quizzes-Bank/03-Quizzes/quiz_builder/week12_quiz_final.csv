Title,Vaccination Rate Confidence Interval,,,,
QuestionText,"A public health survey investigated vaccination coverage differences between populations. In the urban sample, **120** out of **400** respondents reported being vaccinated (yielding a sample proportion p̂₁ = 0.30). In the rural sample, **125** out of **500** respondents were vaccinated (p̂₂ = 0.25).

The observed difference in these sample proportions is Δ = p̂₁ - p̂₂ = +0.05.

Based on this data, what is the plausible range for the *true difference* in vaccination proportions ($p_1 - p_2$) between the underlying urban and rural populations? Select the correct 95% confidence interval below, rounded to three decimal places.",,,,

Title,Interpreting Field Experiment Confidence Interval,,,,
QuestionText,"Field experiments test interventions in real-world settings to understand their causal effects. In this study, researchers wanted to see if the way information was framed could influence voter support for environmental policy.

To estimate the effect of messaging on voter opinion, a randomized experiment was conducted. Group 1 received an SMS message using a **specific policy framing** (e.g., highlighting potential job creation from the bill); out of 800 voters in this group, **200** subsequently expressed support for a climate bill (sample proportion p̂₁ = 0.25). Group 2 (the control group) received a neutral reminder message (e.g., simply stating 'Vote on the climate bill next Tuesday'); out of 600 voters, **180** supported the bill (sample proportion p̂₂ = 0.30).

The observed difference in support rates (treatment - control) is Δ = p̂₁ - p̂₂ = -0.05.

A 95% confidence interval for the true difference in population proportions ($p_1 - p_2$) was calculated as **[ -0.097, -0.003 ]**. Based *only* on this confidence interval and using a 5% significance level (α = 0.05), what conclusion can be drawn about the effectiveness of the policy-framing message compared to the neutral reminder?",,,,
Points,2,,,,
Option,100,The neutral reminder (Group 2) generated *significantly higher* support than the policy framing (Group 1).,,,
Option,0,There is *no statistically significant difference* in support between the two message types.,,,
Option,0,The policy framing (Group 1) generated *significantly higher* support than the neutral reminder (Group 2).,,,
Option,0,The result is inconclusive because the confidence interval includes zero.,,,

Title,Vaccination Rate Comparison: z-statistic,,,,
QuestionText,"A public health department is investigating whether there is a statistically significant difference in COVID-19 vaccination rates between urban and rural populations in their jurisdiction. They collected the following sample data:
* **Urban Sample:** 120 out of 400 residents were vaccinated (p̂₁ = 0.30)
* **Rural Sample:** 125 out of 500 residents were vaccinated (p̂₂ = 0.25)

To formally test the null hypothesis that the true population proportions are equal (H₀: $p_1 = p_2$, meaning $p_1 - p_2 = 0$), calculate the appropriate *pooled two-proportion z-test statistic*. Assume the samples are independent.

Select the value below that best matches your calculation, rounded to two decimal places.",,,,

Title,Field Experiment: z-statistic Calculation,,,,
QuestionText,"Recall the randomized field experiment investigating voter support for a climate bill, comparing a **policy-framing SMS message** (Group 1) against a **neutral reminder** (Group 2). The sample data was:
* Group 1 (Policy Framing): 200/800 supported (p̂₁ = 0.25)
* Group 2 (Neutral): 180/600 supported (p̂₂ = 0.30)

We previously constructed a confidence interval to estimate the difference between these groups ($p_1 - p_2$). Now, let's calculate the **test statistic** needed to formally test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the true population proportions ($H_0: p_1 = p_2$) against the two-sided alternative ($H_a: p_1 \neq p_2$).

Compute the pooled two-proportion z-test statistic. Select the value below that best matches your result, rounded to two decimal places.",,,,
