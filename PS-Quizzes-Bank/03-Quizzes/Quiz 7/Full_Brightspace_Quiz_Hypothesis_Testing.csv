QuestionText,Which of the following correctly states whether the normal approximation is appropriate?,
Option,100,"Yes, because both \( np_0 \) and \( n(1 - p_0) \) are greater than 15."
Option,0,"Yes, because \( \hat{p} \) is close to 0.50."
Option,0,"No, because we don't know the standard deviation."
Option,0,"No, because the sample size is not greater than 30."

QuestionText,Suppose the significance level is \( \alpha = 0.05 \). Which of the following best describes the rejection region for this two-sided test?,
Option,0,Reject \( H_0 \) if \( z > 1.645 \)
Option,100,Reject \( H_0 \) if \( |z| > 1.96 \)
Option,0,Reject \( H_0 \) if \( z < -1.645 \)
Option,0,Reject \( H_0 \) if \( |z| > 2.58 \)

QuestionText,"Based on your test statistic and the rejection region, what is the correct decision?",
Option,100,Reject \( H_0 \); there is sufficient evidence that the proportion is different from 0.50.
Option,0,Fail to reject \( H_0 \); there is not enough evidence that the proportion is different from 0.50.
Option,0,Reject \( H_0 \); the sample proportion equals 0.50.
Option,0,Fail to reject \( H_0 \); the population is not normal.

QuestionText,Which of the following is the most appropriate conclusion?,
Option,0,"The sample shows that 50\% of political science majors approve, so no difference exists in the population."
Option,0,There is significant evidence that the approval rate among political science majors is greater than 50\%.
Option,100,There is not enough evidence to conclude that the approval rate among political science majors is different from 50\%.
Option,0,Political science majors strongly disapprove of the president's handling of the economy.
