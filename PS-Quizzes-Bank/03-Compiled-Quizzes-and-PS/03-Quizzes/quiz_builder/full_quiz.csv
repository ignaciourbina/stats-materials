Title,Conditional Probability from Survey Table,,,,
QuestionText,"<p>A national survey of 700 adults asked two questions: whether they support implementing a federal carbon tax (support coded as 1, and do not support as 0) and how much they agree with the statement:</p>
<p><i>“Climate change poses a serious threat to the country’s future.”</i></p>
<p>Responses to the agreement statement were measured on a 5-point scale (from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree). The results are summarized below:</p>
<table>
<tr><th></th><th>Strongly Disagree</th><th>Disagree</th><th>Neutral</th><th>Somewhat Agree</th><th>Strongly Agree</th></tr>
<tr><td><b>Support Carbon Tax (1)</b></td><td>30</td><td>50</td><td>70</td><td>120</td><td>80</td></tr>

Title,Descriptive Statistics: Ideological Distribution Intro,,,,
QuestionText,"<p>In a public opinion study, respondents were asked to place themselves on an ideological spectrum from 1 (most liberal) to 11 (most conservative). Samples of 200 residents were collected from each of two cities in different states. The table below shows the absolute frequency of responses in each group (e.g., 22 respondents from City A placed themselves at score position of “1,” that is, “most liberal”). Basic summary statistics are also provided.</p>
