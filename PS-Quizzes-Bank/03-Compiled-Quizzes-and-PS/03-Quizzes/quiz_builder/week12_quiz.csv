Title,CI Includes Zero,,,,
QuestionText,A confidence interval that **includes zero** proves there is no difference between the two population proportions.,,,,
Points,1,,,,
True,0,Including zero does NOT *prove* equality; it only indicates insufficient evidence.,,,
False,100,Correct – it suggests we lack evidence but does not prove equality.,,,
