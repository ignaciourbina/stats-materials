Title,Interpreting Field Experiment Confidence Interval,,,,
QuestionText,"<p>Field experiments test interventions in real-world settings to understand their causal effects. In this study, researchers wanted to see if the way information was framed could influence voter support for environmental policy.</p><p>To estimate the effect of messaging on voter opinion, a randomized experiment was conducted. Group 1 received an SMS message using a specific policy framing (e.g., highlighting potential job creation from the bill); out of 800 voters in this group, 200 subsequently expressed support for a climate bill (sample proportion \(\scriptsize \hat{p}_1 = 0.25\)). Group 2 (the control group) received a neutral reminder message (e.g., simply stating 'Vote on the climate bill next Tuesday'); out of 600 voters, 180 supported the bill (sample proportion \(\scriptsize \hat{p}_2 = 0.30\)).</p><p>The observed difference in support rates (treatment - control) is \(\scriptsize \Delta = \hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2 = -0.05\).</p><p>A \(\scriptsize 95\%\) confidence interval for the true difference in population proportions (\(\scriptsize p_1 - p_2\)) was calculated as [ -0.097, -0.003 ]. </p><p>Based *only* on this confidence interval and using a \(\scriptsize 5\%\) significance level (\(\scriptsize \alpha = 0.05\)), what conclusion can be drawn about the effectiveness of the policy-framing message compared to the neutral reminder?</p>",,,,
