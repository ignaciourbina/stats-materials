\section*{Answers and Grading Criteria}

\subsection*{Question 1}
\textbf{Statement:} "Given this data, an urban resident is more likely to support the mayor compared to a rural resident."

\textbf{Data:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Total respondents: 1000
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Urban: 400
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Support Mayor: 280
        \end{itemize}
        \item Rural: 600
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Support Mayor: 360
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Calculations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Probability that a urban resident supports the mayor:
    \[
    P(\text{Supports} | \text{Urban}) = \frac{280}{400} = 0.7
    \]
    \item Probability a rural resident supports the mayor:
    \[
    P(\text{Supports} | \text{Rural}) = \frac{360}{600} = 0.6
    \]
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Justification:}
The probability of an urban resident supporting the mayor is 0.7, while for a rural resident, it is 0.6. Since 0.7 is higher than 0.6, it can be concluded that urban residents are indeed more likely to support the mayor compared to rural residents.

\subsection*{Question 2}
\textbf{Statement:} "There is a higher probability of being in excellent health for people who exercise regularly versus those who donâ€™t."

\textbf{Data:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Total adults: 1200
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Exercise regularly: 400
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Excellent health: 320
        \end{itemize}
        \item Do not exercise regularly: 800
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Excellent health: 200
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Calculations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Probability of being in excellent health when exercising regularly:
    \[
    P(\text{Excellent} | \text{Exercise}) = \frac{320}{400} = 0.8
    \]
    \item Probability of being in excellent health when not exercising regularly:
    \[
    P(\text{Excellent} | \text{No Exercise}) = \frac{200}{800} = 0.25
    \]
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Justification:}
The probability of being in excellent health is significantly higher among those who exercise regularly (0.8) compared to those who do not (0.25). therefore the statement is correct.

\subsection*{Question 3}
\textbf{Statement:} "The probability that a person in the survey uses social media regularly or shops online is greater than 50\%."

\textbf{Data:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Total adults: 1000
    \item Regular social media users: 500
    \item Regular online shoppers: 200
    \item Both: 400
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Calculations:}
Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:
\[
P(\text{Social or Online}) = \frac{500 + 200 - 400}{1000} = \frac{300}{1000} = 0.3
\]

\textbf{Justification:}
The probability that a person uses social media regularly or shops online is 30\%, which is less than 50\%. Therefore, the statement is incorrect.

\subsection*{Question 4}
\textbf{Statement:} "The probability that an adult both supports the new healthcare policy and voted in the last election is 0.24."

\textbf{Given Probabilities:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Probability that an adult supports the new healthcare policy, \( P(A) = 0.40 \)
    \item Probability that an adult voted in the last election, \( P(B) = 0.60 \)
    \item Probability that an adult supports the new healthcare policy given that they voted, \( P(A|B) = 0.50 \)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Calculations:}
To find the probability that an adult both supports the healthcare policy and voted, we use:
\[ P(A \cap B) = P(A|B) \times P(B) \]
\[ P(A \cap B) = 0.50 \times 0.60 = 0.30 \]

\textbf{Justification:}
The calculated probability that an adult both supports the healthcare policy and voted in the last election is 0.30, not 0.24 as stated. Therefore, the statement is incorrect.

\subsection*{Question 5}
\textbf{Statement:} "The probability of a person choosing policy A is 0.20."

\textbf{Given Probabilities:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Probability that a person supports Policy B, \( P(B) = 0.30 \)
    \item Probability that a person supports Policy C, \( P(C) = 0.50 \)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Calculations:}
Since the events (supporting Policy A, B, C) are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, the probabilities must sum to 1. Thus:
\[ P(A) = 1 - (P(B) + P(C)) \]
\[ P(A) = 1 - (0.30 + 0.50) = 0.20 \]

\textbf{Justification:}
The probability of a person choosing Policy A is calculated to be 0.20, which matches the statement, confirming it as correct.

\section*{Detailed Solutions to Subparts of Question 6}

\textbf{Data Overview:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Total countries: 200
    \item Full Democracy (FD): FD \& Low Inequality = 30, FD \& Medium Inequality = 20, FD \& High Inequality = 10
    \item Flawed Democracy (FLD): FLD \& Low Inequality= 20, FLD \& Medium Inequality= 30, FLD \& High Inequality= 20
    \item Electoral Autocracy (EA): EA \& Low Inequality= 10, EA \& Medium Inequality= 20, EA \& High Inequality= 40
    \item Totals by inequality: Low Inequality= 60, Medium Inequality= 70, High Inequality= 70
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{a) Probability that a country is a Full Democracy}
\textbf{Calculation:}
\[ P(\text{FD}) = \frac{30 + 20 + 10}{200} = 0.30 \]
\textbf{Justification:} This calculation sums all countries classified as Full Democracy and divides by the total number of countries, yielding the direct probability of a Full Democracy.

\subsection*{b) Probability that a country does not have Medium Inequality}
\textbf{Direct Counting:}
\[ P(\text{Not Medium}) = \frac{60 + 70}{200} = 0.65 \]
\textbf{Justification:} This is calculated by adding the number of countries with Low and High inequality statuses and dividing by the total number of countries.

\textbf{Alternative Probability Method:}
\[ P(\text{Not Medium}) = 1 - P(\text{Medium}) = 1 - \frac{70}{200} = 0.65 \]
\textbf{Justification:} Using the complement rule calculates the probability by subtracting the probability of Medium Inequality from 1.

\subsection*{c) Probability that a country is a Full Democracy and does not have Medium Inequality}
\textbf{Calculation:}
\[ P(\text{FD and Not Medium}) = \frac{30 + 10}{200} = 0.20 \]
\textbf{Justification:} This direct calculation takes the sum of Full Democracies with Low and High Inequality and divides by the total number of countries.

\subsection*{d) Probability that a country is a Full Democracy given that it has Medium Inequality}
\textbf{Direct Counting:}
\[ P(\text{FD $|$ Medium}) = \frac{20}{70} = 0.2857 \]
\textbf{Justification:} The number of Full Democracies with Medium Inequality is divided by the total number of countries with Medium Inequality, giving the direct conditional probability.

\textbf{Alternative Probability Method:}
\[ P(\text{FD and Medium}) = \frac{20}{200} = 0.10 \]
\[ P(\text{FD $|$ Medium}) = \frac{P(\text{FD and Medium})}{P(\text{Medium})} = \frac{0.10}{0.35} = 0.2857 \]
\textbf{Justification:} Using \( P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \) confirms the direct method's result using probability rules.

\subsection*{e) Probability that a country is either a Flawed Democracy or has High Inequality}
\textbf{Direct Counting:}
\[ P(\text{FLD or High}) = \frac{70 + 70 - 20}{200} = 0.60 \]
\textbf{Justification:} This calculation adds the counts of Flawed Democracies and countries with High Inequality, subtracting the overlap to avoid double-counting.

\textbf{Alternative Probability Method:}
\[ P(\text{FLD or High}) = 0.35 + 0.35 - 0.10 = 0.60 \]
\textbf{Justification:} Applying the inclusion-exclusion principle using known probabilities reinforces the accuracy of the direct counting method.
