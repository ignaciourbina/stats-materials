\section*{3.6 Dice rolls}
If you roll a pair of fair dice, what is the probability of
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] getting a sum of 1?
    \item[(b)] getting a sum of 5?
    \item[(c)] getting a sum of 12?
\end{enumerate}

\section*{3.7 Swing voters}
A Pew Research survey asked 2,373 randomly sampled registered voters their political affiliation (Republican, Democrat, or Independent) and whether or not they identify as swing voters. 35\% of respondents identified as Independent, 23\% identified as swing voters, and 11\% identified as both.\footnote{A swing voter refers to a voter who does not have a strong party affiliation or loyalty and whose vote can "swing" from one party to another, often being decisive in elections. Surveys may ask about past voting behavior to understand if respondents have voted for different parties in past elections. A pattern of alternating between parties can indicate a swing voter.}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] Are being Independent and being a swing voter disjoint, i.e., mutually exclusive?
    \item[(b)] Draw a Venn diagram summarizing the variables and their associated probabilities.
    \item[(c)] What percent of voters are Independent but not swing voters?
    \item[(d)] What percent of voters are Independent or swing voters?
    \item[(e)] What percent of voters are neither Independent nor swing voters?
    \item[(f)] Is the event that someone is a swing voter independent of the event that someone is a political Independent?
\end{enumerate}

\section*{3.8 Poverty and language}
The American Community Survey is an ongoing survey that provides data every year to give communities the current information they need to plan investments and services. The 2010 American Community Survey estimates that 14.6\% of Americans live below the poverty line, 20.7\% speak a language other than English (foreign language) at home, and 4.2\% fall into both categories.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] Are living below the poverty line and speaking a foreign language at home disjoint?
    \item[(b)] Draw a Venn diagram summarizing the variables and their associated probabilities.
    \item[(c)] What percent of Americans live below the poverty line and only speak English at home?
    \item[(d)] What percent of Americans live below the poverty line or speak a foreign language at home?
    \item[(e)] What percent of Americans live above the poverty line and only speak English at home?
    \item[(f)] Is the event that someone lives below the poverty line independent of the event that the person speaks a foreign language at home?

\section*{Democracy and Inequality}

Consider the following joint probability distribution of regimes and economic inequality for a set of countries. The table shows the likelihood of each type of regime associated with low, medium, and high levels of economic inequality.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Regime} & \textbf{Low Inequality} & \textbf{Medium Inequality} & \textbf{High Inequality} \\
\hline
Full Democracy & 0.12 & 0.08 & 0.04 \\
Flawed Democracy & 0.04 & 0.12 & 0.08 \\
Electoral Autocracy & 0.04 & 0.08 & 0.12 \\
Full Autocracy & 0.04 & 0.04 & 0.17 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Answer the following questions based on the table:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] What is the probability that a country is a Full Democracy or has High Economic Inequality? Use the formula for the union of events: \( P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \).
    \item[(b)] Calculate \( P(A \cap B) \), the probability that a country is a Full Democracy and has High Economic Inequality.
    \item[(c)] Calculate the probability that a country is neither a Flawed Democracy nor has Medium Economic Inequality. Use the complement rule: \( P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) \).\footnote{Hint: $(A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c = \neg A \cap \neg B$. $\neg A \cap \neg B$ reads as ``neither $A$ nor $B$.''}
    \item[(d)] Given that a country has Medium Economic Inequality, what is the probability that it is an Electoral Autocracy? Use the formula for conditional probability: \( P(C|D) = P(C \cap D) / P(D) \).
    \item[(e)] Calculate the probability of observing Low Economic Inequality in the sample. This will be used as \( P(B) \) in Bayes' Law.
    \item[(f)] Calculate the probability of a country being a Full Democracy. This will be used as \( P(A) \) in Bayes' Law.
    \item[(g)] Assume we draw one random country from the sample. What is the probability that the country is a Full Democracy, given we know the country has Low Economic Inequality? Use Bayes' rule to compute your answer: \( P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}  \).

\section*{Optional Appendix}

\subsection*{Proof of the Multiplication Rule for Independent Events}

\textbf{Goal:}

To prove that for two independent events \( A \) and \( B \) in a sample space \( S \),

\[ P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B) \]

using a counting argument.

\textbf{Step 1: Calculate \( P(A \cap B) \)}

\[
P(A \cap B) = \frac{N_{A \cap B}}{N}
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( N \) is the total number of equally likely outcomes in the sample space \( S \).
    \item \( N_{A \cap B} \) is the number of outcomes where both \( A \) and \( B \) occur.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Step 2: Calculate \( P(B|A) \)}

The conditional probability \( P(B|A) \) is given by:

\[
P(B|A) = \frac{N_{A \cap B}}{N_A}
\]

where \( N_A \) is the number of outcomes where \( A \) occurs.

\textbf{Step 3: Use Independence}

Independence implies that \( P(B|A) = P(B) \). Thus,

\[
P(B|A) = P(B) = \frac{N_B}{N}
\]

where \( N_B \) is the number of outcomes where \( B \) occurs.

\textbf{Step 4: Equate the Two Expressions for \( P(B|A) \)}

\[
\frac{N_{A \cap B}}{N_A} = \frac{N_B}{N}
\]

\textbf{Step 5: Rearrange to Find \( N_{A \cap B} \)}

Rearranging the above equation, we get:

\[
N_{A \cap B} = N_A \cdot \frac{N_B}{N}
\]

\textbf{Step 6: Substitute Back into the Expression for \( P(A \cap B) \)}

Replace \( N_{A \cap B} \) in the expression for \( P(A \cap B) \):

\[
P(A \cap B) = \frac{N_{A \cap B}}{N} = \frac{N_A \cdot \frac{N_B}{N}}{N}
\]

\textbf{Step 7: Simplify the Expression}

Simplifying the above expression, we get:

\[
P(A \cap B) = \frac{N_A \cdot N_B}{N^2}
\]

Since \( P(A) = \frac{N_A}{N} \) and \( P(B) = \frac{N_B}{N} \), we can rewrite the above expression as:

\[
P(A \cap B) = \frac{N_A}{N} \cdot \frac{N_B}{N} = P(A) \cdot P(B)
\]

\textbf{Conclusion}

We have shown that if \( A \) and \( B \) are independent, then the probability of their intersection is the product of their individual probabilities:

\[
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)
\]

This completes the proof of the multiplication rule for independent events using a counting method.

\subsection*{Proof of the Conditional Probability Formula}

\textbf{Goal:}

To prove that for two events \( A \) and \( B \) in a sample space \( S \),

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \]

using a counting argument.

\textbf{Step 1: Definition of Conditional Probability}

The conditional probability \( P(A|B) \) is given by:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{N_{A \cap B}}{N_B}
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( N \) is the total number of equally likely outcomes in the sample space \( S \).
    \item \( N_{A \cap B} \) is the number of outcomes where both \( A \) and \( B \) occur.
    \item \( N_B \) is the number of outcomes where \( B \) occurs.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Step 2: Multiplying by \( \frac{1}{N} \)}

Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \( \frac{1}{N} \):

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{\frac{N_{A \cap B}}{N}}{\frac{N_B}{N}}
\]

\textbf{Step 3: Substitute the Definitions of Probabilities}

Substitute \( P(A \cap B) = \frac{N_{A \cap B}}{N} \) and \( P(B) = \frac{N_B}{N} \):

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
\]

\textbf{Conclusion}

We have shown that the conditional probability of \( A \) given \( B \) is the ratio of the joint probability of \( A \) and \( B \) to the probability of \( B \):

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
\]

This completes the proof of the conditional probability formula using a counting method and the trick of multiplying by \( \frac{1}{N} \).
