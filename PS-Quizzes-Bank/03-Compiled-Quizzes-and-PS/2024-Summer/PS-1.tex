    \item After reading the following study description, use the four principles of experimental design to analyze how strong the study is in satisfying each principle, and determine if no information is mentioned regarding one of the principles:
    \par Consider a hypothetical political science study that investigates the effect of campaign email strategies on voter turnout. The study selects a small city known for its close election results and politically engaged population. Researchers randomly assign half of the registered voters to receive a weekly email encouraging them to vote, detailing polling station information, and providing transportation options to reach the polling stations. The other half, serving as a comparison group, receives no additional communication. The demographics of the city are diverse, ensuring a broad range of socio-economic backgrounds in the participant pool. The city’s previous voting data is meticulously analyzed to ensure that voters in both groups have historically shown similar voting patterns to avoid bias from past behaviors.

\subsubsection*{7. Confounding Variables (Short Answer)}

You are reviewing the results of an observational study that surveys a representative random sample of American citizens. The study investigates the relationship between educational achievement and political participation. It reports a positive correlation, showing that higher levels of education are associated with increased political participation. You know that previous research has established that higher education levels correlate positively with greater political knowledge, and that such knowledge predicts increased political participation. However, the study in question does not control for or measure political knowledge.
\par Given the scenario described, explain why the absence of controls for political knowledge could be problematic, using the concept of ``confounding variable." \newline
    \par \emph{Provide a detailed justification for your answer below:}

\section*{Concepts and Terms Covered in Unit I}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Observation (Data point): A single measurement or data point collected from a study or experiment. Each observation represents an individual instance of the variables being measured.

    \item Research Question: A question that the research aims to answer, typically framed to investigate the relationship between variables or the effectiveness of different treatments.

    \item Treatment Group: A group of subjects in an experiment that receives the treatment whose effect the researchers wish to study.

    \item Control Group: A group of subjects in an experiment that does not receive the treatment being tested, used as a baseline to measure the effects of the treatment group.

    \item Summary Statistic: A single measure that summarizes or represents the characteristics of a dataset, such as mean, median, standard deviation, etc.

    \item Data Matrix: A rectangular array of data where rows represent individual observations and columns represent variables.

    \item Variables (columns of the data matrix): Features or characteristics that are measured in a study. Each variable represents a different type of data collected from each observation.

    \item Units (rows of the data matrix): The individual entities or subjects from which data are collected in a study, represented as rows in a data matrix.

\item Type of Variables
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Categorical
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Regular Categorical (or Nominal): Variables that categorize or label attributes without any order or ranking (e.g., gender, eye color).
            \item Ordered Categorical: Variables that categorize attributes where the categories have a logical order or ranking but the intervals between categories are not necessarily equal (e.g., ratings such as poor, fair, good, excellent).
        \end{itemize}
        \item Numerical
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Numerical Discrete: Numerical values that can only take integer values within a range (e.g., number of countries visited).
            \item Numerical Continuous: Numerical values that can take any value within a range (any real number), allowing for infinitely fine subdivisions (e.g., sleep measured in hours and minutes).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\item Statistical Association or Relationship:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Independent variables (No association): Variables that do not show any predictive or explanatory relationship between them.
        \item Associated variables:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Positive association: A relationship where increases (decreases) in one variable are associated with increases (decreases) in another variable (i.e., variables move in the same direction).
            \item Negative association: A relationship where increases (decreases) in one variable are associated with decreases (increases) in another variable (i.e., variables move in the opposite direction).
            \item Non-linear association: A relationship between variables that does not follow a straight line, indicating that the effect of one variable on another changes at different levels of those variables.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

\item Causal Relationship: A relationship where one variable directly affects another. That is, keeping every other factor constant, a change in one variable ($X$) \emph{causes} a change in another variable ($Y$). In that case, we say that $X$ \emph{causes} $Y$. This can be established conclusively only through properly controlled experiments.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Response variable (outcome variable or dependent variable): The variable that we are interested in understanding as an outcome of a process.
        \item Explanatory variable: The variable that is believed to be a factor directly influencing another variable (the response or outcome variable). In experiments, the explanatory variable is manipulated or changed to determine if it causes a change in the response variable.
        \item ``Association does not imply causation": A principle stating that just because two variables are associated (correlated), it does not mean that one causes the other to occur.
        \item Confounding variable: An external variable that influences both the explanatory and response variables, potentially misleading the results of a study if not controlled.
    \end{itemize}
\item Types of Studies
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Observational study: A study where the researcher observes and measures characteristics of interest, but does not intervene or manipulate the study environment.
        \item Experimental study: A study where the researcher actively manipulates one or more variables to investigate the effect on other variables, typically to establish causal relationships.
    \end{itemize}
\item Population: The entire set of individuals or objects of interest from which researchers may potentially collect data.
\item Sample:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Representative Sample: A subset of the population that accurately reflects the members of the entire population.
        \item Convenience Sample: A sample selected from the population based on ease of access and not randomly, which may lead to biased results.
        \item Non-response rate and bias: The bias that occurs when the responses received are not representative of the intended sample, often because a significant portion of sampled individuals does not respond.
    \end{itemize}

\item Sampling Strategies
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Simple Random Sample: A sampling method where each set of n elements has an equal chance of being chosen from the population, ensuring each sample is equally representative.
        \item Stratified Sampling: A sampling method that divides the population into homogeneous subgroups known as strata and then takes a simple random sample from each stratum.
        \item Cluster Sampling: A sampling approach where the population is divided into separate groups, known as clusters, usually along geographical boundaries. A random sample of these clusters is chosen, and all observations within selected clusters are included in the sample.
        \item Multi-Stage Sampling: A complex form of cluster sampling where multiple levels of units are embedded one in another. This method involves performing cluster sampling in stages, selecting smaller and smaller groups at each stage.
    \end{itemize}
\item Randomized experiment:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Controlling: The method of holding constant external variables that might influence the experiment, to ensure that any observed effects on the dependent variable are due to the independent variable.
        \item Randomization: The process of randomly assigning subjects to different treatment groups in an experiment to ensure that each subject has an equal chance of receiving any treatment, thus eliminating bias.
        \item Replication: The practice of repeating the experiment on many subjects to ensure that the results are valid and not due to random variation or peculiarities of a single sample.
        \item Blocking: The technique of arranging experimental units into groups (blocks) that are similar to one another. This can reduce the variation in response due to extraneous factors, making it easier to detect differences caused by treatments.
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
