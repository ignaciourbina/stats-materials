# Problem Sets and Quizzes Bank

This directory contains a bank of problem sets, quizzes, and related materials for the course. The content is organized into three main categories:

- **`01-Question-Banks`**: Source `.tex` files containing questions that can be used to create new quizzes and problem sets.
- **`02-Solved-Problems`**: PDF documents with detailed solutions to various statistical problems.
- **`03-Compiled-Quizzes-and-PS`**: A collection of ready-to-use quizzes and problem sets, often from specific course offerings.
