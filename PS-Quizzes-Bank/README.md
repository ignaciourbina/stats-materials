# Problem Sets and Quizzes Bank

This directory contains a bank of problem sets and quizzes for the course.

### File Summaries:

*   **`Conceptual-Questions.tex`**: This document contains a set of six multiple-choice questions focused on the conceptual understanding of estimators in statistics, covering topics such as the goal of statistical inference, the role of random variables, the interpretation of expected value, and the importance of sampling distributions and modeling assumptions.

*   **`Multiple-Choice-Items.tex`**: This document contains a bank of multiple-choice questions covering a wide range of statistical concepts, including descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, properties of the normal distribution, sampling distributions, hypothesis testing, and various statistical tests.

*   **`Probability-Question-Bank.tex`**: This document contains a quiz on probability, with questions covering topics such as conditional probability, the addition and multiplication rules, the law of total probability, and Bayes' theorem.

*   **`Solved Problems - Inference for One Proportion.pdf`**: This document provides solved problems for inference and hypothesis testing for a single proportion, including a step-by-step calculation of a 95% confidence interval and a two-tailed hypothesis test.

*   **`Solved Problems - Probability.pdf`**: This document provides a set of solved problems on probability, covering basic set operations, conditional probability, independence, the law of total probability, Bayes' theorem, and problems involving marbles and dice.

*   **`Solved Problems - Random Variables.pdf`**: This document provides a set of solved problems on random variables, expectations, and moments, covering discrete and continuous distributions, linear combinations of random variables, and the application of these concepts to real-world scenarios.
